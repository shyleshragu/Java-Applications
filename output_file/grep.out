[https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-resources/research-data/data-articles, Data articles are brief, peer-reviewed publications about research data. Sharing data makes it accessible and enables others to gain new insights and make interpretations for their own research. Thanks to a detailed dataset description, the data published in data articles can be reused, reanalyzed and reproduced by others., Your data article contributes to proper data citation and attribution, By thoroughly describing data you facilitate reproducibility, https://towardsdatascience.com/what-i-learned-from-writing-a-data-science-article-every-week-for-a-year-201c0357e0ce, There ought to be a law limiting people to one use of the term �life-changing� to describe a life event. Had a life-changing cup of coffee this morning? Well, hope it was good because that�s the one use you get! If this legislation came to pass, then I would use my allotment on my decision to write about data science. This writing has led directly to 2 data science jobs, altered my career plans, moved me across the country, and ultimately made me more satisfied than when I was a miserable mechanical engineering university student., In 2018, I made a commitment to write on data science and published at least one article per week for a total of 98 posts. It was a year of change for me: a college graduation, 4 jobs, 5 different cities, but the one constant was data science writing. As a culture, we are obsessed by streaks and convinced those who complete them must have gained profound knowledge. Unlike other infatuations, this one may make sense: to do something consistently for an extended period of time, whether that is coding, writing, or staying married, requires impressive commitment. Doing a new thing is easy because our brains crave novelty, but doing the same task over and over once the newness has worn off requires a different level of devotion. Now, to continue the grand tradition of streak completers writing about the wisdom they gained, I�ll describe the lessons learned in �The Year of Data Science Writing.�, The five takeaways from a year of weekly data science writing are:, You can learn everything you need to know to be successful in data science without formal instruction, Writing about data science?�?or anything �is a mutually beneficial relationship as it benefits you and the entire community]
